This repository contains the script for an N-Body simulation of the solar system using Euler's method. 
The files are split into:
  - n-body-simulation.py: A Python file containing a simulation of the solar system for circular orbits
  - n-body-simulator.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook containing both the simulation of the solar system and a modifiable n-body simulation created for educational purposes.

The Jupyter Notebook simulation outputs the animation as a gif file which can be found in the parent directory. 
Note that when changing the initial conditions of the simulation the axes might need rescaling. 
The GIF files get overwritten each time you run the script.
