This repository contains the script for an N-Body simulation of the solar system using Euler's method. 
The files are split into:
  - n-body-simulation.py: A python file containing a simulation of the solar system for circular orbits
  - n-body-simulator.ipynb: A jupyter notebook containing both the simulation of the solar system and a modifiable n-body
                            simulation created for educational purposes.

The jupyter notebook simulation outputs the animation as a gif file which can be found in the parent directory. Note that
when changing the initial conditions of the simulation axes might need rescaling. The gif files get overwritten each time 
you run the script.
